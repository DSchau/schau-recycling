The Iowa Transportation Commission approved more than $3.3 million in funding for seven rail improvement projects as part of the Railroad Revolving Loan and Grant Program (RRLGP). The rail projects are expected to support the creation of 84 new jobs, leverage nearly $25 million in new capital investment and provide $1 million to reconstruct a rail bridge in Waterloo destroyed by floodwaters in 2008.

The RRLGP received $1.5 million in funding through I-JOBS--an $830 million, three-year initiative of the Culver/Judge Administration intended to create jobs, strengthen the state's economy and invest in Iowa's infrastructure. Many modes of transportation in Iowa will benefit from I-JOBS, including a total of $115 million in investments in our state's roads and bridges, freight and passenger rail systems, recreational trails, general aviation airports, and public transit systems. Schau Recycling was one of seven awarded funding.
